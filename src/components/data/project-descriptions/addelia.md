### [Problem]

Personal productivity tools are often fragmented, overcomplicated, or not tailored to modern hybrid lives.  
People struggle to maintain consistent habits, track long-term goals, and gain clarity across all aspects of their life — from fitness and finance to mindset and dreams — in a single, coherent system.

### [Solution & Core Architecture]

**Life Organizer** is a modular personal operating system designed to centralize and streamline all life dimensions in one intuitive interface.  
The system is structured around core pillars:

- **Clarity** – map your goals, tasks, habits, and routines in alignment with your long-term vision  
- **Flow** – maintain structure without rigidity, with weekly templates, flexible scheduling, and mood-based planning  
- **Growth** – track reflections, body metrics, finances, energy, and priorities to improve over time  

Each area (Fitness, Mind, Career, Finance, Relationships...) is built as a block, easily customizable and interconnected via global dashboards and tags.

### [Feature Snapshot]

- Full modular layout with collapsible blocks (Notion-like logic)  
- Smart journaling with daily/weekly/monthly reflections  
- Integrated task system with focus tags (Today / Deep Work / On Hold)  
- Visual habit tracker + routines sync  
- Pre-built templates (morning pages, life audit, 3-month goals)  
- Coming soon: AI prompts for insights + goal suggestions

### [Tech Stack]

**Frontend**:  
Bolt.AI, TailwindCSS, Framer animations

**Backend (planned)**:  
TBD – roadmap includes local-first persistence + cloud sync

**Infra**:  
Currently runs as a local PWA prototype  
Next step: Next.js / Firebase or Supabase for sync version

### [My Role]

Solo creator and designer of the full concept:  
- Designed and structured the entire system  
- Built the layout logic and UX with Bolt  
- Created templates for habit tracking, mental check-ins, and goal planning  
- Currently working on syncing logic and AI integration

### [Current Status]

- Beta version live for personal use  
- Testing templates with select users  
- Gathering feedback to prioritize which blocks to productize

### [Roadmap]

- V1: Public template pack (Notion / Bolt)  
- V2: Cloud version with local-first support  
- V3: AI layer for recommendations and smart reflection  

### [Long-term Vision]

A powerful yet human-first **Life OS** that empowers individuals to track, reflect, and grow holistically —  
like a Notion meets Headspace meets productivity tracker — to help people design a meaningful life, one day at a time.
