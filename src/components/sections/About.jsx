  <p className="about-paragraph">Hi, welcome to my lab, I'm Elisa.</p>

<p className="about-paragraph">

I have a background in Electronic & Computer Engineering, specialized in microelectronics. It taught me how to think in systems, work precisely, and stay curious. I've always loved to understand how things work, to create, and to solve problems.

</p>


<p className="about-paragraph">

Over the past few years, I’ve imagined, designed, and led several product initiatives: from a booking platform for independent professionals to internal tools for productivity, automation, and user experience. Some are still in development, others have been shelved, but each taught me a lot and has been an incredible adventure.

</p>


<p className="about-paragraph">

As a co-founder of <strong>Elisium</strong>, I’ve worked directly with clients, coordinated remote dev teams, and explored how to align execution with vision, even with challenging time or resources.

</p>


<p className="about-paragraph">

Today, I navigate between product strategy, UX, and development, depending on the challenge. I’m not attached to one title, what I care about is achieving my goals.

</p>


<p className="about-paragraph">

<strong>Labelis</strong> is my personal lab, a space where I think, explore, build, and push ideas a bit further.

</p>


<p className="about-paragraph">

What defines me? I’m a builder. I love imagining and transforming ideas into real, thoughtful products. I care about clarity, usefulness, and depth, and I’m not afraid to rethink everything when it doesn’t feel right.
