### [Problem]
Cold-calling and lead qualification is resource-heavy and inconsistent. Existing AI agents lack realism or require high infrastructure costs.

### [Solution & Core Architecture]
An AI-driven teleprospection tool was scoped to deliver:

Natural conversation with LLM and VoIP integration

Scripted yet adaptive logic for qualification

Cost-optimized pipeline (Whisper/OpenAI + STT/TTS alternatives)

### [Feature Snapshot]
Voice synthesis + speech-to-text for real-time calls

Custom prompt scripting engine

Qualification form filling from dialogue

CRM sync and call history logs

### [Tech Stack]
AI Stack (planned):
OpenAI (GPT/Whisper), Mozilla TTS, Google STT, Node

Infra (target):
Docker, Railway, scalable STT/TTS services

### [My Role]
Architected MVP design to fit client’s $35K budget

Researched optimization tradeoffs for STT/TTS

Scoped fallback LLM behaviors + hallucination mitigation

### [Current Status]
Not developed (client budget/staffing paused project)

Tech feasibility validated

Potential pivot into AI lead generation SaaS

### [Roadmap]
Prototype voice flow with STT fallback

AI agent evaluation vs scripted trees

Beta test on real lead lists

### [Long-term Vision]
Create an AI-assisted cold-caller that reduces human cost while increasing lead qualification speed — fully transparent, customizable, and integrable into any CRM.
