### [Problem]

Booking local services is fragmented, inefficient, and inconvenient.  
Clients struggle to find trustworthy professionals, compare offers, and book appointments seamlessly.  
Professionals lack digital tools to manage bookings, payments, and client relationships — especially across different service categories.  
Most existing solutions are siloed (beauty-only, repairs-only) and miss a unified mobile-first experience.

### [Solution & Core Architecture]

Timz is a two-sided, mobile-first platform that connects clients with local service professionals.  
It streamlines:

- **Discovery** – intuitive search by service, location, availability  
- **Booking & Payment** – real-time slots, Stripe/PayPal integration  
- **CRM** – lightweight tools for professionals to manage clients, income, and campaigns

The platform includes:

- A **Client App** (React Native)  
- A **Pro App** (React Native)  
- A **Pro Web Dashboard** (React)  
- A **Backend API** (FastAPI, PostgreSQL)  
- Admin panel for moderation, refunds, metrics

### [Feature Snapshot]

- Calendar sync & manual/auto booking confirmation  
- Client grouping (VIP, blacklist, private access)  
- Smart availability filters & “available now” logic  
- Messaging system tied to bookings  
- Deposits & full payment flows with commission handling  
- CRM campaigns, analytics & tagging (Premium)  
- External booking link generator (WhatsApp, email)

### [Tech Stack]

**Frontend**:  
React Native (Expo), TypeScript, TailwindCSS  
React (Pro Web Dashboard), Next.js (planned)

**Backend**:  
FastAPI, PostgreSQL (UUIDs), SQLAlchemy, Alembic  
Redis (planned), Celery (post-MVP), JWT, OAuth2  

**Infra**:  
Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Railway / Render  
Cloudinary or AWS S3 (media), Stripe, Twilio, Firebase  

### [My Role]

I built the entire backend architecture and API:  
- FastAPI project structure with modular routing & services  
- PostgreSQL schema: users, bookings, services, payments  
- Auth system: multi-role (client, pro, admin) with JWT/OAuth2  
- Business logic: booking engine, payment rules, CRM, access groups  
- Setup of CI/CD pipelines and cloud deployment for MVP  
- API spec + functional requirements (SRS/SDD) written from scratch

### [Current Status]

- Backend MVP complete (auth, booking, payments, CRM)  
- Data models, migrations, and security validated  
- Client & Pro apps: UI build started (React Native)  
- Admin features & dashboards in design phase  
- Preparing onboarding strategy + early user testing

### [Roadmap]

- MVP release: client ↔ pro booking + payment  
- V2: advanced CRM, group rules, team features  
- V3: dynamic availability engine + AI-driven ranking  
- V4: automated marketing & loyalty engine

### [Long-term Vision]

A mobile-first **Wolt for services**:  
One single app to discover, book, and manage all types of appointments.  
For professionals: an all-in-one business OS with CRM, analytics, and automation.
